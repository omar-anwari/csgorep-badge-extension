# Privacy Policy

Effective date: [2026-01-08]

CSGORep Badge ("the extension") adds a CSGORep reputation badge to Steam profile pages.

## Data we collect and transmit
- Steam profile ID (SteamID) from the profile page you visit.
- This SteamID is sent to https://csgo-rep.com/ to retrieve public reputation data.

The extension does not collect names, emails, passwords, payment details, or browsing history beyond the Steam profile page where it runs.

## How we use data
- The SteamID is used only to request CSGORep reputation data for the viewed profile.
- No analytics, advertising, or tracking is performed.

## Data sharing
- The SteamID is transmitted to CSGORep’s API to fetch reputation data. Their handling of data is governed by their own policies.
- We do not sell or transfer user data to other third parties.

## Data storage and retention
- The extension does not store personal data.
- Responses are used to render the badge and are not persisted by the extension.

## Security
I take reasonable measures to minimize data use and only transmit what is required for the badge to function.

## Your choices
If you do not want your SteamID transmitted, do not use the extension or disable it on Steam profile pages.

## Changes
We may update this policy from time to time. The latest version will be posted on this github.
